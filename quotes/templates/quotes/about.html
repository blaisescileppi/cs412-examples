    <p>
      Clive Staples Lewis (1898-1963), better known as C.S. Lewis, was a British author,
      scholar, and Anglican lay theologian. He's best known for his Chronicles of Narnia series and
      Christian apologetics. Born in Belfast, Ireland, Lewis studied at Oxford and became a professor of
      English literature at both Oxford and Cambridge. A devout atheist in his youth, Lewis converted to
      Christianity after conversations with J.R.R. Tolkien and Hugo Dyson. (Google Overview).
